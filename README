solhsm-core software
=====================

Simple Light and Open HSM is project that allows OpenSSL's users to enhance 
security by storing private keys on a Harware Security Module based on a 
BeagleBoneBlack (or whatever if you want). The Hardware Security Module
works with the solHSM-PROTOCOL in order to communicate over IP with an
OpenSSL ENGINE (solHSM-ENGINE).

solHSM-Core is the main software on the HSM that provide some basics 
cyptographic operations.
